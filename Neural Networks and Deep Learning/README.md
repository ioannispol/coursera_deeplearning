# Python Basics with numpy (optional)

Welcome to your first (Optional) programming exercise of the deep learning specialization. In this assignment you will:

- Learn how to use numpy.

- Implement some basic core deep learning functions such as the softmax, sigmoid, dsigmoid, etc...

- Learn how to handle data by normalizing inputs and reshaping images.

- Recognize the importance of vectorization.

- Understand how python broadcasting works. 

This assignment prepares you well for the upcoming assignment. Take your time to complete it and make sure you get the expected outputs when working through the different exercises. In some code blocks, you will find a "#GRADED FUNCTION: functionName" comment. Please do not modify it. After you are done, submit your work and check your results. You need to score 70% to pass. Good luck :) !
